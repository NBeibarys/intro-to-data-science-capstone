    "This project assesses university professors using a large, publicly available dataset scraped from RateMyProfessor.com. The objective is to integrate core concepts from the course into a single applied analysis and to extract actionable insights about teaching quality and student perceptions. The dataset contains aggregated student ratings and related attributes for a broad sample of professors, with low individual response rates but substantial overall scale. Prior research reports a correlation of approximately 0.7 between RateMyProfessor ratings and official end-of-course teaching evaluations, which supports the analytical value of this source despite known response bias. All data collection and basic structuring steps were completed in advance, while data science-relevant preprocessing, including the identification and handling of missing data, was performed in this project. To address the research questions, appropriate statistical methods were selected based on underlying assumptions, with explicit justification provided throughout the report. Visualizations support interpretation and highlight key patterns in the data. All hypothesis testing uses α = 0.005 to reduce false positive findings (Habibzadeh, 2025). \n"

    "A large block of missing data appears in the dataset. Exactly 19,889 records share missing values across all core numerical, categorical, and qualitative variables, with the exception of the “would take again” column. These missing values occur in the same row positions, which indicates a systematic issue rather than random missingness. In addition, all tag variables equal zero for these same records, which implies an absence of meaningful rating information rather than true zero-valued responses. Together, these patterns suggest these rows do not represent valid professor evaluations. Removing all 19,889 records is therefore justified, as retaining them would introduce noise and bias."

    "This section addresses the reliability of average professor ratings. An average rating based on very few student evaluations is unstable and can produce extreme values that do not reflect typical teaching quality. Professors with only one or two ratings are therefore not comparable to those evaluated by many students. To reduce noise and improve interpretability, an optimal number of ratings threshold is chosen and applied so that average ratings are computed and analyzed only when they are supported by a sufficient volume of observations. This choice reduces the influence of outliers driven by sparse data and ensures that comparisons across professors rely on more reliable estimates."

    "The distribution of the number of ratings is highly right skewed, with a median of 3 and a mean of 5.4. Most professors receive only a small number of ratings, which leads to unstable and potentially extreme average values. To address this, we set a minimum threshold of five ratings and excluded professors with fewer than five evaluations. This cutoff is close to the mean and removes cases where average ratings are driven by very sparse data, while preserving the majority of the sample and improving the reliability of comparisons across professors. After applying this filter, 25,368 professors remain in the analysis dataset.\n"

    "In this section, we address the handling of categorical variables. Teaching style tags were normalized by dividing each tag count by the total number of tags received by a professor, converting raw counts into proportions. This normalization controls for differences in the total number of ratings and ensures that tag values are comparable across professors. Cases with no assigned tags resulted in undefined values after normalization and were set to zero, reflecting the absence of tag information rather than meaningful signal.\n",

    "`Rationale for the test:` For this question, we test whether male professors receive higher average ratings than female professors. Average ratings are bounded, derived from ordinal Likert-scale responses, and do not reliably satisfy normality assumptions at the individual professor level. Population parameters such as the true mean and variance are unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore use a one-sided Mann-Whitney U test, which is appropriate for comparing central tendency between two independent groups without assuming normality. This test evaluates whether ratings for one group tend to be systematically higher than those for the other, consistent with the directional hypothesis of pro-male bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Null hypothesis (H0):` The median average rating for male professors is equal to the median average rating for female professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Alternative hypothesis (Ha):` The median average rating for male professors is higher than the median average rating for female professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Significance level:` 0.005\n",
    "\n",
    "`Interpretation:` The p-value represents the probability of observing a difference in average ratings at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "- If the p-value is smaller than 0.005, we reject H0 and conclude that there is statistically significant evidence of a pro-male bias in average ratings.\n",
    "- If the p-value is larger than 0.005, we fail to reject H0 and conclude that the observed difference is consistent with random variation and does not provide sufficient evidence of gender bias."

    "Our p-value (0.00024523) is smaller than the significance threshold of 0.005, so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the median average rating for male professors is higher than that for female professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result does not establish causal evidence of pro-male rating bias, as the data are observational, not randomized, and we do not control for all potential confounders such as course type, institution, teaching experience, or selection effects in who chooses to rate professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we do find statistical evidence of a systematic difference in ratings by gender, with male professors receiving higher typical ratings in this dataset. This pattern is consistent with, but does not by itself prove, the presence of pro-male bias in average professor ratings."

    "The density curves for average ratings by gender are highly similar, indicating comparable dispersion for male and female professors. Both distributions cover a similar range of ratings and exhibit similar tail behavior, suggesting no substantial difference in variability. While the male distribution appears slightly shifted to the right, consistent with higher typical ratings observed in Q1, the overall spread and shape of the distributions closely align.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a visual inspection, we do not observe meaningful differences in variance or dispersion between the two groups. Any differences in spread appear minor relative to the overall similarity of the distributions and are unlikely to reflect a practically important gender difference in rating variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This visual evidence suggests that gender differences in ratings are primarily related to central tendency rather than dispersion, motivating a formal statistical test of variance in the subsequent analysis."

    "### Levene's test \n",
    "\n",
    "`Rationale for the test:` This question asks whether male and female professors differ in the spread of their average rating distributions. We need a test of dispersion, not a test of location. Average ratings are bounded (1 to 5) and do not satisfy normality assumptions, so classical variance tests that rely on normality, such as an F-test, are not appropriate. We therefore use Levene's test because it tests equality of variance while remaining robust under non-normal data. We use the median-centered version to further reduce sensitivity to skewness and outliers. The test is two-tailed because the question asks whether dispersion differs in either direction, not whether one gender has higher variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Null hypothesis (H0):` The dispersion (variance) of average ratings for male professors is equal to the dispersion of average ratings for female professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Alternative hypothesis (Ha):` The dispersion of average ratings significantly differs between male and female professors.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Significance level:` 0.005\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is smaller than 0.005, we reject H0 and conclude that the dispersion of average ratings differs significantly by gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is larger than 0.005, we fail to reject H0, indicating that the observed difference in dispersion is consistent with random variation and that the data do not provide sufficient statistical evidence of a gender difference in rating variability.\n"

    "A 95 percent confidence interval means that, over repeated samples, 95 percent of such intervals would contain the true Cliff’s delta. In this case, the estimated Cliff’s delta lies between 0.0127 and 0.0466, with a point estimate of 0.0297. This corresponds to a negligible effect size, meaning that the distributions of average ratings for male and female professors are almost entirely overlapping. Although this difference is statistically detectable given the large sample size, it does not represent a practically meaningful difference in central tendency and provides little evidence of substantive gender bias in average ratings.\n",

    "The estimated variance difference in average ratings between male and female professors is −0.0776, with a 95 percent CI from −0.1128 to −0.0411. The interval lies entirely below zero, indicating that average ratings for female professors exhibit slightly greater dispersion than those for male professors. However, the magnitude of this difference is very small in absolute terms. This suggests that, although the difference in spread is statistically detectable due to the large sample size, it is negligible in practice and provides little evidence of meaningful gender bias in rating variability."

    "`Rationale for the test:` Each teaching tag is converted into a proportion of all tags awarded to a professor in order to account for differences in the total number of ratings. These tag proportions are bounded between 0 and 1 and exhibit skewness, violating normality and equal variance assumptions. Parametric tests are therefore not appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare tag distributions between male and female professors, we use a two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. This non-parametric test is suitable for comparing two independent groups on ordinal or non-normal data and evaluates whether one group tends to receive systematically higher or lower tag proportions than the other.\n",

    "\n",
    "`Significance level:` 0.005\n",

    "The p-value represents the probability of observing a difference in tag proportions, or a more extreme one, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is smaller than 0.005, we reject H0 and conclude that the tag is awarded in significantly different proportions to male and female professors.\n",
    "If the p-value is larger than 0.005, we fail to reject H0 and conclude that any observed difference is consistent with random variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This test is applied separately to each of the 20 teaching tags in the dataset in order to identify which tags exhibit statistically significant gender differences."

    "After computing a 95% confidence interval using bootstrap resampling, the estimated Cliff's delta lies between -0.0152 and 0.0182, with a point estimate of 0.0018. This corresponds to a negligible effect size, indicating that the distributions of average difficulty ratings for male and female professors almost completely overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the confidence interval includes zero and remains well within the negligible range, there is no practical evidence of a meaningful gender difference in perceived course difficulty. This result reinforces the hypothesis test findings and suggests that any statistically detectable differences are not substantively important at the user-experience level."

    "The correlations indicate that average ratings are driven primarily by student satisfaction and course rigor rather than demographics. Would take again shows an extremely strong positive association with ratings, while average difficulty exhibits a strong negative relationship, suggesting that harder courses tend to receive lower evaluations. Received a pepper has a moderate positive association, whereas gender, number of ratings, and online share show near-zero correlations, indicating minimal influence. These results suggest that instructional experience and perceived difficulty dominate rating outcomes, while demographic and exposure-related variables contribute little explanatory value."

The LightGBM model without imputation achieves a CV RMSE of approximately ~0.554, improving substantially over the best linear specification, whose CV RMSE is around ~0.568. This gain carries over to the test set, where LightGBM attains a testing RMSE of about ~0.552 and an R² of roughly ~0.656, compared to a testing RMSE of approximately ~0.561 and an R² near ~0.644 for the transformed reduced Lasso model.

As expected based on the earlier correlation analysis, variables related to perceived teaching quality and classroom experience carry the largest coefficients, while many workload and structural indicators have coefficients close to zero once stronger predictors are included. This confirms that much of the predictive signal is concentrated in a relatively small subset of tags.\n",

By comparing cross-validated R² and RMSE across these thresholds, we assess how aggressively the feature set can be reduced before predictive performance begins to deteriorate.

This motivates the use of regularized linear models. Lasso alone risks arbitrarily selecting a single variable from a correlated group, while Ridge retains all predictors without sparsity. Given the observed correlation patterns, `ElasticNet` is well-suited, as it allows correlated predictors to be shrunk together while still performing feature selection, leading to more stable and interpretable models under this dependency structure."

    "The strongest correlation is observed for `quality_minus_workload` (~ 0.81). This indicates that ratings increase most when indicators of teaching quality substantially outweigh indicators of workload intensity. In other words, even demanding courses receive high ratings when strong instructional quality compensates for the workload, while heavy workload without sufficient teaching quality is penalized.

    "Inspection of the final `ElasticNet coefficient estimates` shows clear convergence toward the same small subset of predictors identified in the previous feature-engineering step. The largest standardized coefficient remains `teaching_quality_index`, which dominates all other variables and captures the primary source of variation in ratings. The next strongest effects consistently correspond to `tough_grader`, `structure_index_positive`, and core teaching quality tags such as `amazing_lectures`, `good_feedback`, `accessible`, and `dont_skip_class_or_you_will_not_pass`. These variables form the same core group that defined the earlier `7-feature engineered Lasso model`.\n",

    "All remaining predictors either have substantially smaller coefficients or are shrunk exactly to zero. Notably, the engineered contrast variables that were introduced to compress signal, such as `quality_minus_workload` and `quality_minus_structure_negative`, are fully eliminated once the model is regularized. This indicates that their informational content is already absorbed by the retained indices and tags and that they do not provide additional incremental signal in the multivariate setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repeated selection of the same small group of variables across different specifications and regularization schemes provides strong evidence that the model has stabilized. Further rounds of feature engineering or pruning are unlikely to yield meaningful gains in either performance or interpretability. At this point, additional complexity would primarily introduce noise rather than signal.\n",

    "The final sparse linear specification is the `7-feature engineered Lasso model`, which represents the best balance between predictive performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency. It preserves nearly all of the explanatory power of the full linear models while relying on a compact and stable set of predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the modeling objective were instead shifted from this balance toward pure `performance maximization`, then linear sparsity would no longer be the primary concern. In that case, more flexible nonlinear models such as gradient-boosted trees would be appropriate to evaluate, as they can automatically capture higher-order interactions and nonlinear effects that linear models intentionally ignore."

Lasso tests whether automatic feature selection yields a more parsimonious model without sacrificing accuracy.\n",

    "To capture a larger share of the underlying signal and potentially reduce RMSE, we construct the same set of engineered indices as in Question 8, aggregating related tags into broader dimensions such as teaching quality, workload, and course structure. The correlation results above show that these indices are strongly associated with their component variables, confirming that they successfully compress meaningful variation. However, because the indices and individual tags encode overlapping information, this transformation also introduces the risk of multicollinearity. We therefore proceed by explicitly examining the correlation structure among predictors to assess the extent of multicollinearity before fitting multivariate models."

Teaching quality, workload, and structure indices are all highly correlated with multiple individual features, creating clear multicollinearity in the full specification. In this setting, fitting Lasso directly would be unstable, since it would arbitrarily select one variable from a correlated group and discard the rest. Therefore, the correct first step is to fit ElasticNet, which can handle correlated predictors by shrinking them jointly. Only after identifying a stable set of important variables through ElasticNet does it make sense to perform feature reduction and then refit a Lasso model for sparsity and interpretability."

    "Weselect the 8-feature `ElasticNet specification` as the final reduced linear model. Relative to the full engineered ElasticNet, this model incurs only a very small loss in cross-validated performance, with RMSE increasing from approximately 0.541 to about 0.544, which is well within expected cross-validation noise. At the same time, it substantially improves parsimony by removing a large number of weak predictors whose contribution to predictive accuracy is negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further reduction beyond eight variables is not justified. Once the model is constrained to seven or fewer predictors, RMSE increases more sharply and R² declines meaningfully, indicating that relevant signal is being discarded rather than redundant noise. Thus, eight predictors represent the practical lower bound at which the engineered linear model retains nearly all of the explanatory power of the full specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the 8-feature ElasticNet model provides the best balance between predictive performance, interpretability, and stability. It captures the dominant structure in the data while avoiding unnecessary complexity, making it the preferred linear specification under a parsimony-aware modeling objective.\n",

    "We therefore inspect pairwise correlations within the 8-feature subset. If correlations remain moderate and below commonly used thresholds for concern, the remaining predictors no longer pose a serious multicollinearity risk. In that case, the benefits of ElasticNet diminish, since its L2 component is primarily needed to stabilize estimates under strong dependence.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no severe multicollinearity is present, we can refit the model using LassoCV on these eight variables. This yields a simpler and more efficient estimator, preserves sparsity, and improves interpretability by relying purely on L1 regularization. ElasticNet is only retained if meaningful collinearity persists; otherwise, Lasso becomes the appropriate final linear model for this reduced feature set."

    "The dominant driver of higher average difficulty is `tough_grader`. A larger value strongly increases perceived difficulty, which is consistent with students associating strict grading with harder courses. This effect is the largest in the model and clearly dominates all others.\n",
    "\n",
    "`teaching_quality_index` has a negative coefficient, indicating that higher teaching quality is associated with lower perceived difficulty, holding grading strictness constant. This suggests that good instruction, clarity, and support make courses feel easier even when the material itself may be challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "`structure_index_negative` also has a negative coefficient. This index aggregates features such as group projects, fewer grading components, participation-based evaluation, and extra credit. Higher values therefore reflect more flexible or forgiving course structures, which are associated with lower perceived difficulty.\n",

    "The remaining variables play secondary roles. `accessible` slightly increases perceived difficulty, likely capturing that accessibility often co-occurs with demanding courses that require frequent interaction. `clear_grading` and `hilarious` both reduce difficulty modestly, suggesting that transparency and classroom atmosphere soften how demanding a course feels. `test_heavy` increases difficulty, but its effect is small once grading strictness and structure are accounted for. `caring` has a minor negative effect, reinforcing that instructor support marginally reduces perceived difficulty.\n",

    "Overall, this final model is coherent and interpretable. Perceived difficulty is primarily driven by grading strictness, then moderated downward by teaching quality and course structure. The model achieves this with a small set of features and minimal redundancy, preserving interpretability while retaining most of the predictive signal."

    "The strongest correlations are not individual tags but aggregated and contrast features. `tough_grader` and `workload_index` have the highest positive correlations, confirming that perceived difficulty is driven by grading strictness and overall workload intensity. More importantly, contrast features such as `quality_minus_workload` and `workload_minus_structure_negative` appear among the top signals with large magnitudes. This shows that difficulty is determined by imbalance, specifically when workload dominates teaching quality or when workload overwhelms flexible structure. These effects are stronger than many raw tags, which validates encoding tradeoffs explicitly rather than relying on the model to infer them indirectly.\n",

    "Teaching quality variables consistently load in the opposite direction. `teaching_quality_index` and `quality_minus_structure_positive` are strongly negatively correlated, indicating that strong instruction and positive structure offset difficulty even in demanding courses. Individual quality tags such as `caring`, `respected`, `good_feedback`, `amazing_lectures`, `hilarious`, and `inspirational` all reinforce this pattern with moderate negative correlations. This confirms that these tags capture the same underlying dimension, which motivated collapsing them into a single index in the first place.\n",

The derived structure indices reflect this split and show smaller magnitudes than workload or grading, indicating that structure matters, but mainly through how it interacts with workload rather than as a standalone driver.\n",

    "Overall, the correlation table confirms the core modeling hypothesis same as from Q8. Difficulty is not driven by single tags in isolation.

At this point, testing `XGBoost` would almost certainly reproduce the same structure and deliver marginal or no improvement while increasing training cost and explanation burden.

    "Looking at cross-validation first, the key result is that all models achieve almost identical ROC AUC around 0.79, which means they rank observations equally well and extract essentially the same signal. The main difference is not discrimination but decision behavior. Tuned LightGBM reaches extremely high recall ( ~ 91%) but with much lower precision (~ 55%), indicating an aggressive positive classification strategy that trades many false positives for sensitivity. In contrast, ElasticNet and logistic models operate at a more balanced point, with recall and precision both around 0.66-0.68 without any thresholding yet. Since AUC is the same across models, LightGBM is not learning a better representation of the problem, it is simply choosing a different operating point. "

    "On test data, both models converge to almost the same operating point. ROC AUC differs by about 0.01, which is within noise and does not indicate a meaningful ranking advantage for LightGBM. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 are nearly identical. LightGBM achieves slightly higher recall, but this comes with lower specificity and more false positives, as seen in the confusion matrix. ElasticNet trades a small amount of recall for better specificity, while matching LightGBM on F1 almost exactly. This confirms that both models are extracting the same signal and making similar errors. The boosted model is not discovering new structure, only shifting the decision boundary. In practical terms, this is convergence across model families, which signals that additional complexity is not buying real performance gains."
